## 🌍 Predicting Air Quality with Machine Learning! 🚀
I'm excited to share my recent work on a Predicting Air Quality with Machine Learning System, a machine learning model designed to analyze data and predict Air Quality values based on various factors, including:
 
CO_AQI_Value
Ozone_AQI_Value
NO2_AQI_Value
PM2_5_AQI_Value
Latitude
Liquefied_Natural_Gas

Air pollution is a major global concern, impacting health, climate, and overall quality of life. To address this, I recently worked on an Air Quality Prediction Model using machine learning to Prediction  AQI (Air Quality Index) values based on real-world data. 📊

🔍 Key Highlights of the Project: ✅ Dataset Analysis – Processed and cleaned air quality data to extract meaningful insights.
✅ Feature Engineering – Identified key pollutants affecting air quality.
✅ Model Training – Leveraged ML techniques to predict AQI values accurately.
✅ Evaluation & Optimization – Used metrics like RMSE and R² to refine predictions.

🔧 Tech Stack: Python, pandas, sci-kit-learn, and data visualization tools, Numpy, pandas, matplotlib, LinearRegression, R2_score, XGBRegressor, RandomForestRegressor
